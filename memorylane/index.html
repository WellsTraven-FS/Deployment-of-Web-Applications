                        Technology has really made its way to the front of
                        mankind! In many ways technology has helped us, but also
                        made us forget the little things that matter.

                        In the first week of my class I learned that a developer
                        could utilize the deployment abilities to a live server.
                        Never have i would have think that it would have that
                        type of power. Very very interesting!

                        There's a question that's been floating around my
                        membrame for quite some time. This question has brought
                        me clarity, but also has sparked a ventureous idea of
                        taking on the next journey to conquer this. Is there a
                        smooth transitioning into Artificial Intelligence from
                        Software Development? Please, let me know !
