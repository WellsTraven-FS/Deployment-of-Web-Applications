                I would have to say that this week's assiggnments were quite
                challenging. What I've discovered and expressed to my wife
                numerous times about development is that its so many ways to do
                one thing! For instance, just when I thought I had Reactjs
                figured out here are more steps to attaching your frontend to
                the backend. Not only, API's are a different animal!. Last month
                I learned to render through twig, now I'm rendering another way.
                Technology is amazing, but it does become overwhelming. What I
                consistently tell myself is you're only at the beginning.
                Everything seems this way because its new, but it will come with
                time.
