                There's a question that's been floating around my membrame for
                quite some time. This question has brought me clarity, but also
                has sparked a ventureous idea of taking on the next journey to
                conquer this. Is there a smooth transitioning into Artificial
                Intelligence from Software Development? Please, let me know !
            </p>
