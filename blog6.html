                    This week has been quite interesting. I found the process to
                    autheticating an API was straight forward, although I did
                    run into a few setbacks. For some reason that is not known
                    by me, the protected route process would not allow my signup
                    or login to navigate to the the next page after recieving
                    its key and value. The next issue I ran into was with axios.
                    There is a message that keeps popping up in the console once
                    a email and password is entered during signup and login. The
                    error is stating that there's a bad request, which I don't
                    know how that came to be since following the lecture videos
                    step by step. I sent my instructor a video through slack of
                    the difficulties I'm running into. I'm hoping he contacts me
                    before the day is over.
