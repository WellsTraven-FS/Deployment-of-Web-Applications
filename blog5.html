                A recent side tutorial I've completed last week was establishing
                the connection between the API server and the FrontEnd. In the
                frontend portion of that tutorial, we had to bring in the values
                of our chosen or created model. The process was straight
                forward, but it had a handful of steps to complete before
                establishing that connection. In order to become proficent, you
                will most likely have to complete that tutorial and process
                again. There's a lot of steps to undgo before even moving on the
                the styling part your api. Once the connection is established,
                styling and deploying is a breeze!
