                    A recent side tutorial I've completed last week was
                    establishing the connection between the API server and the
                    FrontEnd. In the frontend portion of that tutorial, we had
                    to bring in the values of our chosen or created model. The
                    process was straight forward, but it had a handful of steps
                    to complete before establishing that connection. In order to
                    become proficent, you will most likely have to complete that
                    tutorial and process again. There's a lot of steps to undgo
                    before even moving on the the styling part your api. Once
                    the connection is established, styling and deploying is a
                    breeze!
